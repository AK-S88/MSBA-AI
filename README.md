# ü§ñ MSBA AI Chatbot ‚Äì Google Capstone Project  
**An Academic Project from UMass Lowell's MSBA Program**

üéì **Course**: Capstone Project  
üè´ **Institution**: University of Massachusetts Lowell  
üë®‚Äçüî¨ **Role**: Lead Data Scientist & Engineer  
üìÅ **Domain**: Generative AI ¬∑ Information Retrieval ¬∑ Natural Language Processing



## üîç Overview  
This project involves building a **custom AI chatbot** designed to answer queries from the **UMass Lowell MSBA website** using **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)**.

The chatbot is optimized to:
- Accurately retrieve context from university program pages
- Generate relevant, coherent, and helpful responses
- Handle ambiguity using a feedback loop



## üõ†Ô∏è Key Concepts & Tools  
- üß† **RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)**  
- üìö **Sentence Transformers (HuggingFace)** for dense semantic search  
- üßæ **Text Chunking & Cleaning**  
- üóÉÔ∏è **Custom Embeddings** for fine-tuned document similarity  
- ü™Ñ **QA Pair Generation** for chatbot grounding  
- üîÑ **Feedback Loop Integration** for continuous learning  
- üíª **Gradio & Streamlit** *(future deployment goals)*



## üìä Worflow Summary  
1. **Data Collection** ‚Äì Program pages scraped and cleaned  
2. **Text Processing** ‚Äì Split into meaningful chunks  
3. **Embedding Generation** ‚Äì Using `sentence-transformers`  
4. **RAG System** ‚Äì Retrieve + Generate answers  
5. **Chat UI & Feedback** ‚Äì Lightweight interface with learning capability

## üöÄ Future Enhancements  
- üó£Ô∏è Voice-based query handling  
- üåê Live deployment via Gradio or Streamlit  
- üìà Response evaluation dashboard  
- üîÅ Real-time feedback integration
